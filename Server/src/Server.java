/**

 * name by sending the client the text "SUBMITNAME", and keeps requesting a name until
 * a unique one is received. After a client submits a unique name, the server acknowledges
 * with "NAMEACCEPTED". Then all messages from that client will be broadcast to all other
 * clients that have submitted a unique screen name. The broadcast messages are prefixed
 * with "MESSAGE".
 *
 * This is just a teaching example so it can be enhanced in many ways, e.g., better
 * logging. Another is to accept a lot of fun commands, like Slack.
